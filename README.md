# FPGA projects: 
Purpose :  To share the experience gained from implementing FPGA projects, this repository will be updated with the following key items, which include but not limited to 

- RTL in Verilog, System Verilog
- High level synthesis with C, C++, Matlab, etc
- Industrial interfaces: I2C, SPI, MIPI CSI-2, JTAG, etc
- FPGA projects implementation for video and image processing, using machine learning (ML) and artificial intelligence (AI).
